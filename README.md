### `How to run`

    git clone https://github.com/foxxxyproxy/frontend-assignment.git
    cd frontend-assignment
    yarn install
    yarn start

It runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

I did use functional components for this project, but I can use class components as well.<br>
There is still a big room for improvement like adding more tests, split components into smaller ones.<br>
I also would like to add the opportunity to select a suggest item with Arrow keys: Up and Down (now you can do it with Tab button).<br>

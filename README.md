## de Bijenkorf Frontend Dev assignment

This project allows de Bijenkorf to asses potential frontend candidates with real, working code.

It is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to give you the initial setup.

If you are not familiar with Create React App you can find an up to date guide [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/cra-template/template/README.md).

## Folder Structure

The initial project structure looks like this:

```
frontend-dev-assignment/
  .storybook/
  api/
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    favicon.ico
    index.html
    logo192.png
    logo512.png
    manifest.json
    robots.txt
  src/
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    serviceWorker.js
  README.md
```

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>

## Installing dependencies
Due to an dependency conflict with Webpack between the installed version of Create React App and Storybook you should use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) to install the project's dependencies.

## Exercises
You will find the exercises and associated instructions in separate named folders in the root of this project. This assignment is [timeboxed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing) to **8 hours** max.

## Notes
If you have any remarks or observations while working on this assignment you are encouraged submit these along with the assignment.

## Submitting your code
When you complete the assignment either push your local working copy to a remote repository or email us a .zip file with your solution. **Please do not fork this repository**.
